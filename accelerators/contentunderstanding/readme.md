#  Content Understanding Flow Accelerator
## Objectives
Copilot Studio is a native tool that can be extended with various Azure AI capabilities. Thanks to this accelerators, we can enhance its functionality and significantly improve performance. The accelerator enables Copilot Studio to use Azure AI Content Understanding for multimodal extraction (documents, images, audio, and video), automatically transforming unstructured enterprise content into structured and grounded outputs.

On this case importing the [Content Understanding Flow] we were able to connect Copilot Studio with Content Understanding in a more efficient way, enabling advanced search capabilities and improving the overall user experience.

***

# 1) Prerequisites & What you’ll import

*   **Power Platform environments** (Dev → Test/Prod) with **Dataverse**.
*   A **solution (.zip)** that contains:
    *   Your **cloud flow** (solution‑aware).
    *   Your **custom connector** (solution‑aware).
    *   **Connection references** used by the flow/connector.
*   Permissions to **import solutions** and activate flows/connectors. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions)
*   A **Content Understanding resource** with API key and endpoint. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/how-to/create-multi-service-resource)

> **Why solutions?** Solutions package apps, flows, connectors, env‑vars and make **ALM** (export/import, managed vs unmanaged) consistent across environments. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions)

***

# 2) Import the solution into your target environment

1.  Go to **Power Apps** → **Solutions** → **Import solution**.

![Solutions Import](images/02.png)
2.  Upload the **solution file** and select **Next**.
3.  In **Advanced settings**, keep the option to enable **plugin steps and flows**.
4.  Proceed with **Import**, then **Publish all customizations** once done. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions)

***

# 3) Configure connection references & authenticate

After import:

1.  Open the **solution** → review **Content Understanding connector** click on it to edit the connections to your Content Understanding service.
2.  On the connector page, click **Edit** to modify its connections and Content Understanding endpoint.

3.  On General change host name to yor Content Understanding endpoint. Such us <your_content_understanding_name>.services.ai.azure.com. Do not type https://

4.  Leave steps 2, 3 and 4 as is.
5.  On Test tab, create a new connection using your **api-key** from Content Understanding.

6.  Save the connector clicking in **update connector**. Now your connector is ready to be used in the flow.

# 4) Finish Review at copilot Studio

Go to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/). Check you are in the right environment. In tools section you will be hable to see, the connector and the flow.

Then click on the flow to open it and test it.

Now you can check the flows steps and familiarize yourself with its logic.

Flow Overview
1. Trigger
The flow starts manually using a button.
The user provides the following inputs:

BaseUrl
Body
Subscription Key
Operation
api-version


2. Initialize Variables
The flow initializes the following variables:

| Variable | Default Value |
|---|---|
| finish | Completed |
| id | (empty) |
| operation-type | prebuilt-invoice |
| api-version | 2025-11-01 |

3. API Version Condition

If an api-version is provided by the user, the flow updates the variable.
Otherwise, the default value is retained.


4. Set Operation
The operation-type variable is updated based on the user input.

5. Call API
The flow calls the Content Understanding API using:

The provided request body
The selected operation
The specified parameters


6. Store Status and ID
The flow extracts and stores the following values from the API response:

status
id


7. Do Until Loop
The flow enters a loop that repeats up to 20 times or until:
finish == "Succeeded"

Each iteration performs the following steps:

Waits 15 seconds
Calls the API again to retrieve the result using the stored id
Updates the finish variable with the latest status

***

# 5) How to use it

1.  In the design view of copilot studio. Cliclk on **Test** button on the top right corner.
![Test Flow](images/11.png)
2.  A panel will open on the right side where you can set the parameters for the flow.
*       Select Manually to insert the parameters.
*       Select Automatically if you want to use a previous parameters configuration. (This option will be only available after you have run the flow at least once)
*       Click test.

3.  Paste the **Body** of the request you want to send to Content Understanding. You can find examples of the body in the [test-sample](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/quickstart/use-rest-api?tabs=rest-api%2Cimage&pivots=programming-language-rest) .  

4.  Choose the **Operation** based on the file you want to analyze : `prebuilt-invoice`, `prebuilt-imageSearch`, `prebuilt-audioSearch`, `prebuilt-videoSearch` or `customanalysis` if you have any defined in the content undertanding playground [create-custom-analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/tutorial/create-custom-analyzer?tabs=portal%2Cdocument&pivots=programming-language-rest).

5.  Fill the **api-version** default value 2025-11-01.

6.  Click on **Run flow** to execute it.

Note: If you are using the http flow instead of the custom connector, you will need to fill the **BaseUrl** with your Content Understanding endpoint `https://<your service>.services.ai.azure.com/` and the **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key** with your API key from Content Understanding.
